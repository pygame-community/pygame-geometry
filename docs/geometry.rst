:mod:`geometry module`
==================

.. currentmodule:: geometry

The geometry module contains classes and functions for working with 2D geometric
objects such as Lines, Circles, and Polygons. Each object has a set of methods
for performing transformations, collisions, and other operations. The module
also contains a suite of standalone functions for performing operations such as
raycasting and other.

Functions
=========
The geometry module also contains a number of standalone functions for performing operations
such as raycasting and general utility functions.

    .. method:: raycast

        | :sl:`Returns the closest intersection point between a ray and a sequence of colliders`
        | :sg:`raycast(line, colliders) -> (x, y) | None`
        | :sg:`raycast(origin, angle, max_dist, colliders) -> (x, y) | None`
        | :sg:`raycast(origin, direction, max_dist, colliders) -> (x, y) | None`

        This function returns the closest intersection point between a ray and a sequence
        of colliders.
        A ray can be defined by a Line, an origin point and an angle, or an origin point
        and a direction.
        Apart from a Line, which has fixed length, the ray can have any length,
        including infinite length. To define an infinite ray, set the max_dist parameter
        to a negative value. The max_dist parameter cannot be set to 0.
        The colliders can be any sequence of objects Circle, Line, or Rect.

        The function returns a tuple containing the x and y coordinates of the closest intersection
        point, or None if no intersection was found.

    .. method:: regular_polygon

        | :sl:`Returns a regular polygon with the given number of sides`
        | :sg:`regular_polygon(sides, center, radius, angle=0) -> Polygon`

        This function returns a regular polygon with the given number of sides.
        The polygon is centered at the given center point and has the given radius.
        The polygon can be rotated by the given angle through the optional
        `angle` parameter, defaulting to 0.

      .. ## geometry.regular_polygon ##

    .. method:: rect_to_polygon

        | :sl:`Returns a polygon that represents the given rectangle`
        | :sg:`rect_to_polygon(rect) -> Polygon`

        This function is used to convert a rectangle into a polygon.
        The resulting polygon will have four vertices, one for each corner of the
        rectangle. For example, if the input rectangle is specified as Rect(0, 0, 10, 10),
        the resulting polygon will have the following vertices:

        Polygon([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10), (0, 10)])

        which represent the top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left corners
        of the rectangle, respectively.

      .. ## geometry.rect_to_polygon ##

    .. method:: is_line

        | :sl:`Checks if the given object is a geometry.Line`
        | :sg:`is_line(obj) -> bool`

        This function checks if the given object is a geometry.Line.
        It returns True if the object is a geometry.Line, and False otherwise.

        .. note::

            If the python object subclasses the geometry.Line class, this function will
            return False. Note that this function is equivalent to isinstance(obj, Line).
            Using that isinstance check is better for typechecking with mypy, and more
            explicit - so itâ€™s recommended to use that instead of is_line.
            Utilizing is_line can save an unwanted Line import.

      .. ## geometry.is_line ##

    .. method:: is_circle

        | :sl:`Checks if the given object is a geometry.Circle`
        | :sg:`is_circle(obj) -> bool`

        This function checks if the given object is a geometry.Circle.
        It returns True if the object is a geometry.Circle, and False otherwise.

        .. note::

            If the python object subclasses the geometry.Circle class, this function will
            return False. Note that this function is equivalent to isinstance(obj, Circle).
            Using that isinstance check is better for typechecking with mypy, and more
            explicit - so itâ€™s recommended to use that instead of is_circle.
            Utilizing is_circle can save an unwanted Circle import.

      .. ## geometry.is_circle ##

    .. method:: is_polygon

        | :sl:`Checks if the given object is a geometry.Polygon`
        | :sg:`is_polygon(obj) -> bool`

        This function checks if the given object is a geometry.Polygon.
        It returns True if the object is a geometry.Polygon, and False otherwise.

        .. note::

            If the python object subclasses the geometry.Polygon class, this function will
            return False. Note that this function is equivalent to isinstance(obj, Polygon).
            Using that isinstance check is better for typechecking with mypy, and more
            explicit - so itâ€™s recommended to use that instead of is_polygon.
            Utilizing is_polygon can save an unwanted Polygon import.

      .. ## geometry.is_polygon ##

    .. method:: multiraycast

        | :sl:`Returns a list of intersection points between a sequence of rays and a sequence of colliders`
        | :sg:`multiraycast(rays, colliders) -> [(x, y) | None]`

        This function returns a list of intersection points between a sequence of
        rays and a sequence of colliders.
        The rays parameter is a sequence that can be composed of the following objects:

        - Line objects.
        - Tuples of: origin point, angle, max_dist.
        - Tuples of: origin point, direction, max_dist.
        - Tuples of: origin point, end point.

        Apart from Lines, which have fixed length, the rays can have any length,
        including infinite length. To define an infinite ray, set the max_dist parameter
        to a negative value. The max_dist parameter cannot be set to 0.
        The colliders can be any sequence of objects such as Circle, Line, or Rect.

        The function returns a list of tuples containing the closest intersection point to
        the ray's origin, or None if it couldn't find one.

.. class:: Line

    | :sl:`pygame object for representing a Line`
    | :sg:`Line(xa, ya, xb, yb) -> Line`
    | :sg:`Line(first, second) -> Line`
    | :sg:`Line(line) -> Line`


    The `Line` class provides many useful methods for collision, transform and intersection.
    A `Line` can be created from a pair of coordinates that represent the first and second
    point of the `Line`. Lines can also be created from python objects that are already a
    `Line` or have an attribute named "line".

    Specifically, to construct a `Line` you can pass the xa, ya, xb, yb values as
    separate arguments or inside a sequence(list or tuple).

    Functions that require a `Line` argument may also accept these values as Lines:
    ::
        ((xa, ya), (xb, yb))
        (xa, ya, xb, yb)

    **You cannot create degenerate Lines(lines with the same start and end point). If you
    try, the `Line` will not be created and an error will be raised.**

Line Attributes
------
    The `Line` class has both virtual and non-virtual attributes. Non-virtual attributes
    are attributes that are stored in the `Line` object itself. Virtual attributes are the
    result of calculations that utilize the Line's non-virtual attributes.

    Here is the list of all the attributes of the `Line` class:

    .. attribute:: xa
        | :sl:`x coordinate of the first point of the line`
        | :sg:`xa -> float`

        The `x` coordinate of the first point of the `Line`. It can be reassigned to
        move the `Line`. Reassigning the `xa` attribute will move x position of the first
        point to the new `x` coordinate. The `ya`, `xb`, `yb` attributes will not be affected.

    .. attribute:: ya
        | :sl:`y coordinate of the first point of the line`
        | :sg:`ya -> float`

        The `y` coordinate of the first point of the `Line`. It can be reassigned to
        move the `Line`. Reassigning the `ya` attribute will move x position of the first
        point to the new `y` coordinate. The `xa`, `xb`, `yb` attributes will not be affected.

    .. attribute:: xb
        | :sl:`x coordinate of the second point of the line`
        | :sg:`xb -> float`

        The `x` coordinate of the second point of the `Line`. It can be reassigned to
        move the `Line`. Reassigning the `xb` attribute will move x position of the first
        point to the new `x` coordinate. The `xa`, `ya`, `yb` attributes will not be affected.

    .. attribute:: yb
        | :sl:`y coordinate of the second point of the line`
        | :sg:`yb -> float`

        The `y` coordinate of the second point of the `Line`. It can be reassigned to
        move the `Line`. Reassigning the `yb` attribute will move x position of the first
        point to the new y` coordinate. The `xa`, `ya`, `xb` attributes will not be affected.

    .. attribute:: a
        | :sl:`the first point of the line`
        | :sg:`a -> (float, float)`

        It's a tuple containing the `xa` and `ya` attributes representing the line's first point.
        It can be reassigned to move the `Line`. If reassigned the `xa` and `ya` attributes
        will be changed to produce a `Line` with matching first point position.
        The `xb` and `yb` attributes will not be affected.

    .. attribute:: b
        | :sl:`the second point of the line`
        | :sg:`b -> (float, float)`

        It's a tuple containing `xb` and `yb` attributes representing the line's second point.
        It can be reassigned to move the `Line`. If reassigned the `xb` and `yb` attributes
        will be changed to produce a `Line` with matching second point position.
        The `xa` and `ya` attributes will not be affected.

    .. attribute:: length
        | :sl:`the length of the line`
        | :sg:`length -> float`

        The length of the line. Calculated using the `sqrt((xb-xa)**2 + (yb-ya)**2)` formula.
        This attribute is read-only, it cannot be reassigned. To change the line's length
        use the `scale` method or change its `a` or `b` attributes.

    .. attribute:: angle
        | :sl:`the angle of the line`
        | :sg:`angle -> float`

        The angle of the line representing its orientation. Calculated using
        the `atan2(yb - ya, xb - xa)` formula. This attribute is read-only, it cannot
        be reassigned. To change the line's angle use the `rotate` method or change
        its `a` or `b` attributes.

    .. attribute:: slope
        | :sl:`the slope of the line`
        | :sg:`slope -> float`

        The slope of the line. Calculated using the `(yb - ya) / (xb - xa)` formula.
        This attribute is read-only, it cannot be reassigned. To change the line's slope
        use the `rotate` method or change its `a` or `b` attributes.

    .. attribute:: center
        | :sl:`the coordinate of the middle point of the line`
        | :sg:`center -> (float, float)`

        The center of the line. Calculated using the `((xa + xb) / 2, (ya + yb) / 2)` formula.
        It can be reassigned to move the `Line`. If reassigned the `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`
        attributes will be changed in order to produce a `Line` with matching center.

    .. attribute:: centerx
        | :sl:`the x coordinate of the middle point of the line`
        | :sg:`centerx -> float`

        The `x` coordinate of the center of the line, it's calculated using
        the `((xa + xb) / 2)` formula. It can be reassigned to move the `Line`.
        If reassigned the `xa` and `xb` attributes will be changed in order to
        produce a `Line` with matching center. The `ya` and `yb` attributes will not
        be affected.

    .. attribute:: centery
        | :sl:`the y coordinate of the middle point of the line`
        | :sg:`centery -> float`

        The `y` coordinate of the center of the `Line`, it's calculated using
        the `((ya + yb) / 2)` formula. It can be reassigned to move the `Line`.
        If reassigned the `ya` and `yb` attributes will be changed in order to
        produce a `Line` with matching center. The `xa` and `xb` attributes will not
        be affected.

Line Methods
------
    The Line functions which modify the position, orientation or size return a new copy of
    the `Line` with the affected changes. The original `Line` is not modified.
    Some methods have an alternate "in-place" version that returns `None` but affects the
    original `Line`. These "in-place" methods are denoted with the "ip" suffix.

    Here is the list of all the methods of the `Line` class:

    .. method:: move

        | :sl:`moves the line by a given amount`
        | :sg:`move((x, y)) -> Line`
        | :sg:`move(x, y) -> Line`

        Returns a new Line that is moved by the given offset. The original Line is
        not modified.

        .. note::
            This method is equivalent(behaviour wise) to the following code:
            ::
                Line(line.xa + x, line.ya + y, line.xb + x, line.yb + y)

      .. ## Line.move ##

        | :sg:`move_ip(x, y) -> None`

        Moves the Line by the given offset. The original Line is modified. Always returns
        None.

        .. note::
            This method is equivalent(behaviour wise) to the following code:
            ::
                line.xa += x
                line.ya += y
                line.xb += x
                line.yb += y

      .. ## Line.move_ip ##

        | :sg:`update(Line) -> None`

        Updates the `Line`'s attributes. The original Line is modified. Always returns None.

        .. note::
            This method is equivalent(behaviour wise) to the following code:
            ::
                line.xa = xa
                line.ya = ya
                line.xb = xb

    .. method:: as_rect

        | :sl:`returns the line as a Rect`
        | :sg:`as_rect() -> Rect`

        Returns a `pygame.Rect` object that contains the Line. The Rect object will be
        the smallest rectangle that contains the Line.

      .. ## Line.as_rect ##

    .. method:: scale

        | :sl:`scales the line by the given factor from the given origin`
        | :sg:`scale(factor, origin) -> Line`
        | :sg:`scale(factor_and_origin) -> Line`

        Returns a new `Line` which is scaled by the given factor from the specified origin with 0.0 being
        the startpoint, 0.5 being the center and 1.0 being the end point.
        The original `Line` is not modified.

      .. ## Line.scale ##

    .. method:: scale_ip

        | :sg:`is_parallel(Line) -> bool`

        Returns True if the `Line` is parallel to the given `Line`, False otherwise.

      .. ## Line.is_parallel ##

    .. method:: is_perpendicular

        | :sl:`test if the line is perpendicular to another line`
        | :sg:`is_perpendicular(Line) -> bool`

        Returns True if the `Line` is perpendicular to the given `Line`, False otherwise.

      .. ## Line.is_perpendicular ##


    .. method:: collidepoint

        | :sl:`test if a point is on the line`
        | :sg:`collidepoint((x, y)) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collidepoint(x, y) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collidepoint(Vector2) -> bool`

        Returns True if the given point is on the `Line`, False otherwise.

      .. ## Line.collidepoint ##

    .. method:: collideline

        | :sl:`test if a line intersects with another line`
        | :sg:`collideline(Line) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collideline((xa, ya), (xb, yb)) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collideline(xa, ya, xb, yb) -> bool`

        Returns True if the `Line` intersects with the given `Line`, False otherwise.

      .. ## Line.collideline ##

    .. method:: colliderect

        | :sl:`test if a line intersects with a rectangle`
        | :sg:`colliderect(Rect) -> bool`
        | :sg:`colliderect((x, y, w, h)) -> bool`
        | :sg:`colliderect(x, y, w, h) -> bool`

        Returns True if the `Line` intersects with the given `Rect`, False otherwise.

      .. ## Line.colliderect ##

    .. method:: collidecircle

        | :sl:`test if a line intersects with a circle`
        | :sg:`collidecircle(Circle) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collidecircle((x, y, r)) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collidecircle(x, y, r) -> bool`

        Returns True if the `Line` intersects with the given `Circle`, False otherwise.

      .. ## Line.collidecircle ##

    .. method:: collidepolygon

        | :sl:`test if a line intersects with a polygon`
        | :sg:`collidepolygon(Polygon, only_edges=False) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collidepolygon((xa, ya), (xb, yb), ..., only_edges=False) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collidepolygon(xa, ya, xb, yb, ..., only_edges=False) -> bool`

        Tests whether a given `Polygon` collides with the `Line`.
        It takes either a `Polygon` or Polygon-like object as an argument and it returns
        `True` if the polygon collides with the `Line`, `False` otherwise.

        The optional `only_edges` argument can be set to `True` to only test whether the
        edges of the polygon intersect the `Line`. This means that a Line that is
        inscribed by the `Polygon` or completely outside of it will not be considered colliding.
        This can be useful for performance reasons if you only care about the edges of the
        polygon.

        .. note::
            Keep in mind that the more vertices the polygon has, the more CPU time it will
            take to calculate the collision.

      .. ## Line.collidepolygon ##


    .. method:: collide

        | :sl:`test if a shape or point and the line collide`
        | :sg:`collide(Line) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collide(Circle) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collide(Rect) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collide(Polygon) -> bool`
        | :sg:`collide((x, y)) -> bool`
        | :sg:`contains(Vector2) -> bool`

        Returns `True` if any portion of the shape or point overlaps with the Line,
        `False` otherwise. This is a general alternative to the collision problem as it can
        be used to test for collisions with any shape or point. The shape can be a
        `Line`, `Circle`, `Polygon`, or `Rect`. The point can be a tuple or list containing the x and y
        coordinates of the point or a Vector2.

        .. note::
            If a shape is passed it must be an actual single shape object. It cannot be a
            tuple or list of coordinates that represent the shape. This is because there
            is no way to determine what type of shape the coordinates represent.

        .. note::
            Collisions with a `Polygon` object are evaluated the same way the :meth:`collidepolygon`
            method does by default, meaning with only_edges set to `False`.

      .. ## Line.collide ##


    .. method:: as_circle

        | :sl:`returns a circle that extends over the line`
        | :sg:`as_circle() -> Circle`

        Returns a `Circle` object, with the center point being the center point of the `Line`,
        and the diameter being the length of the `Line`.

      .. ## Line.as_circle ##


    .. method:: at

        | :sl:`returns the point at a given distance from the line's a point`
        | :sg:`at(fac) -> (x, y)`

        Returns the point at the given distance from the line's a point.
        The distance can be negative, in which case the point will be on the continuation of
        the line, but in the opposite direction.

      .. ## Line.at ##

    .. method:: copy

        | :sl:`returns a copy of the line`
        | :sg:`copy() -> Line`

        Returns a new `Line` having the same position and radius as the original.

      .. ## Line.copy ##

    .. method:: as_segments

        | :sl:`returns the line as a list of segments`
        | :sg:`as_segments(n_segments) -> [(x, y), (x, y)]`

        Segments the original line into N Lines of equal length and returns a list of
        them. The number of segments is determined by the `n_segments` parameter.

        .. note::
            The original line is not modified. The returned list of lines will always
            have the first line's `a` point at the same position as the original line's `a`
            point and the last line's `b` point at the same position as the original line's
            `b` point.


      .. ## Line.as_segments ##

    .. method:: as_points

        | :sl:`returns the line as a list of points`
        | :sg:`as_points(n_points) -> [(x, y), (x, y)]`

        Returns a list of points that represent the line. The first point in the list
        will be the line's `a` point and the last point will be the line's `b` point.
        The number of points is determined by the `n_points` parameter.

        .. note::
            The n_points parameter refers to the number of points that will created in
            between the line's `a` and `b` points. The number of points returned will
            always be n_points + 2. Because of this the n_points parameter must be at
            least 0.

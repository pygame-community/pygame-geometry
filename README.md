pygame_geometry is a free Python implementation of
polygons, circles, lines, and raycasting. The main
purpose of this repository is to help users integrate
special colliders easier for their video game.

**Everything you see in this repository is subject to change as
this project is heavily in development.** This decision is also
subject to change when this project migrates to the
[official pygame repository](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) or
becomes a third-party library.
